To whom it may concerned:  
Hello! This is Beijing Network Industry Association. We found that these two users ‘dnmkrgi’ and ‘xi-yu-yan-kai-fa’ are making sound simulation software on the Github platform. I report to you these illegal users.  
After our careful verification, these two storage links and the following five links all violate Chinese laws. Please delete all the links and shut down the account.  
https://github.com/xi-yu-yan-kai-fa?tab=repositories  
https://github.com/dnmkrgi?tab=repositories  
https://github.com/xi-yu-yan-kai-fa/Xi-Yuyan  
https://github.com/xi-yu-yan-kai-fa/Dao-Che  
https://github.com/xi-yu-yan-kai-fa/xi-winnie-rainbow-fart  
https://github.com/dnmkrgi/xi-speech-synthesizer  
https://github.com/dnmkrgi/xi-speech-demo  
Such software can easily be used by people with ulterior motives to conduct with illegal activities. This behavior violates the third paragraph of Article 15 of China’s ‘Administrative Rules for Internet Information Services’ that internet information service providers shall not make, copy, publish, or spread ‘Contents that harm national honor and interest.’  
Please delete the relevant information and shut down the 2 accounts.  
Best wishes  
Thanks,
